// Exercise 1: Basic Types Manipulation
// Declare a function that takes two numbers as parameters and returns their sum.
// Ensure that the types are correctly specified.
const sumNumbers = (a: number, b: number):number => {
    return a + b
};

console.info(sumNumbers(10, 12))

// Exercise 2: Interfaces and Objects
// Declare an interface with the following properties: name (string), age (number), and city (string).
// Create a function that takes an object of this type and returns a formatted string with its information.

// Exercise 3: Classes and Methods
// Create a class with a property "name" and a method that returns a message indicating the sound the animal makes.
// Create a subclass that inherits from this class and overrides the method to return a specific sound.

// Exercise 4: Generics
// Create a generic function that takes an array of type T and returns an array of type T but reversed.

// Exercise 5: Promises and Asynchronous Programming
// Write an asynchronous function that takes a number of milliseconds as a parameter
// and returns a promise that resolves after this delay.
